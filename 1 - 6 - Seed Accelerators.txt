Hello again.
And welcome back to Beyond Silicon Valley.
I'm Michael Goldberg.
Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have an
array of
options, to provide the financing and
support they
need to grow their companies, including
seed accelerators,
well-developed angel networks and a
vibrant venture capital community.
Private sector investors are putting up
the capital to support these
investments with a focus on achieving a
healthy return on investment.
But what if you're an entrepreneur and
you live in a transitioning economy, where
private
investors are not willing or able to put
the resources necessary into early stage
capital vehicles.

During the next three lectures, we will
examine how government and donor resources
are being used in communities like
Cleveland,
to support access to capital and
mentorship.
In this lecture, we will look at seed
accelerators,
and some of the key points you'll learn
are.
The history of seed accelerators, and why
they are important?
How seed accelerators work, and measuring
the success of seed accelerators?
The seed accelerator movement started in
Silicon
Valley in 2005, with a creation y
combinator.
It incubated several successful companies,
including Dropbox and Airbnb.
Entrepreneurs apply for admission to seed
accelerators based on
their idea and, if accepted, receive
mentorship, training, and
support over several months in exchange
for giving up
an ownership percentage of their company
to the seed accelerator.
Seed accelerators try to provide their
portfolio companies, with access
to talent, business development partners,
and follow-on investors during the
program.
Y combinator is funded by private
investors, who's investment
is driven by a focus on making a profit.
There are now approximately 200 seed
accelerators around the world.
Unlike y combinator's private investment
model, most of
the seed accelerators in transitioning
economies are supported
in part by governments or donors, since
the
private sector alone is not providing the
necessary resources.
Entrepreneur Mike Belsito is the
co-founder of eFuneral.
>> In the United States, funeral
services are actually performed by outside
companies,
by for-profit business that help families
with all of the end of life planning.
And eFuneral.com is a place where families
can go to to
get more information about those
companies,
and about funeral planning in general.
>> Mike and his business partner were
working full-time at a technology
company in Cleveland, when they came up
with their idea for eFuneral.
They decided to apply to a new seat
accelerator program called 10X.
X, that was being funded in part by the
State government
of Ohio's Third Frontier program to
develop their idea into a company.
>> We also found that about this
accelerator program
the State of Ohio was launching called the
10 Accelerator.
And basically it worked the same that a
lot of
accelerators work, where they'd offer a
small amount of money.
It was $20,000, and in this case it was a
grant.
So they weren't asking for equity.
But it was a, it was a grant where we
wouldn't have to pay it back.
But the real key to us was they're
offering a lot of mentorship.
They're offering connections to,
entrepreneurs that have done this before.
To investors.
To people who can help us realize our
vision.
And so we decided, if we could get into
this accelerator program.
That might be the opportunity where this
could be more than just a
side project for researching mornings, and
nights
and we would actually dedicate ourselves
full-time.
>> Dorothy Baunach believes it was
critical to
provide entrepreneurs like Mike Belstedo
with early stage capital.
>> What we needed to do was find the tools
that they needed, once they got the bug
about being entrepreneur.
They needed early stage capital, they
needed mentoring.
Legal and accounting systems that were
geared for
a start-up not for a billion dollar
corporation.
And so, we were really changing our whole
way of thinking about business and the
infrastructure necessary, necessary to
support an entrepreneurial culture.
>> If the State government of California
is not putting public resources into wide
comminator,
why is it considered necessary for the
State government of Ohio to fund seed
accelerators?
Lisa Delp is the former executive director
of Ohio Third Frontier program.
>> In addition to losing our manufacturing
jobs
in Ohio, we also suffer from low brain
drain.
Our kids want to go some place where
there's exciting opportunities.
There's startups.
There's entrepreneurship.
And they're attracted by things like the
y-combinator and tech stars.
You know, and the other organizations that
have created accelerator programs.
That say, you know, come to Silicon Valley
and we'll
help you start your business and it'll all
be wonderful.
We didn't have anything like that in Ohio.
We didn't have any, any opportunity to
give those
young students who have that idea, and
that entrepreneurial spirit.
So, the Third Frontier brought in a new
program called The One Fund.
This came in about 2010, and it was
designed to help accelerate those
companies, to provide the resources to an
institution a university in the early
stages.
That would mentor and coach those, those
young entrepreneurs through, get them
started in business.
And then bring the rest of them that work
around them to provide the services, and
the capital resources and then the later
term
coaching, and talent and all of those
things.
>> Similar to the Third Frontier program
we
discussed in earlier lectures, seed
accelerators that want to
receive a grant from the one fund are
required to find local matching private
investors or donors.
Morris Wheeler is a leading angel investor
in Cleveland.
>> The one fun match, I think is a
very interesting and important way for an
accelerator to work.
In, in my view for an accelerator to
ultimately be
successful, and for the start up community
to be ultimately successful.
Private capital needs to be engaged.
And, what the One Fund Match does, is it
allows a, a group to,
raise money from private individuals and
essentially
leverage and give them a higher return
than they would have had.
And, by having the matching fund.
>> Entrepreneur Mike Belsito argues that
the support, he received
through the 10X Accelerator by the Third
Frontier was critical.
>> I think it's interesting that the State
of Ohio decided to start their
first accelerator program, as a non profit
accelerator as a sort of a government
venture.
I think the reason why they did that is
they realized
that competing with Silicon Valley, is
something that's really difficult to do,
and in fact, they have to act differently
if they want to
get companies to start their businesses
here, as opposed to Silicon Valley.
So, from the State of Ohio's perspective,
yes, it does take a little bit
of money to put in and start this program
and continue to fund it.
But at the same time, they're seeing
tech companies get their businesses
started here.
Rather than it be just a foregone
conclusion that, hey, if you want
to start a tech business, you're going to
have to go to San Fransisco.
They wanted to actually take action.
They actually wanted to something about
seeing these entrepreneurs leave.
And try to keep them here.
And I can say with our experience.
It was a big reason why we stayed here,
the fact that we could access
those funds, even though they were small
amount
of funds in the grand scheme of things.
And, and never have to pay it back right.
It, it came to us as a grant, that was
really attractive for us as opposed
to going to an accellerator where we had
to give off equity right off the bad.
>> There are different ways government or
donor support,
can be structured to back entrepreneurs
through seed accelerators.
As Mike describes, the investment he
received from the third
frontier through the 10X feed accelerator
was structured as a grant.
Another scheme utilized by the third
frontier
allows feed accelerators to use the one
time grants to take equity ownership, in
the start up companies they are
supporting.
Typical terms for an accelerator in Ohio,
is
to take 8% ownership for a $25,000
investment.
Most of the seed accelerators in Ohio,
including 10X, are organized as non-profit
organizations.
If any of the companies from the
accelerators
are acquired or have an initial public
offering, the
proceeds that come back to the seed
accelerator
from an exit would be invested in new
companies.
Similar to the Evergreen fund model that
JumpStart uses.
>> The nice thing about some of
these non-profit accelerators in
particular is the
way that their model works when an exit
happens, when they see capital return.
Where does that go?
Well it goes right back into starting new
companies.
It goes to make sure that a new fund can
be developed.
I think that's the whole point of some of
these non-profit accelerators.
Lets get tech businesses started.
Lets create this platform for them, and
lets continue to provide the resources.
So those exits make that happen.
>> Although only a handful of accelerators
in the US are beginning to see some of
their portfolio companies grow
significantly, the accelerator model
is spreading quickly both in the US and
internationally.
A 2013 report by AD and Village Capital
found that outside the US.
That 75% of seed accelerators rely on some
type of philanthropic
support and, over 50% of seed accelerator
overall funding comes from donors.
kLab, in Kigali, Rwanda is an example of
such an international seed accelerator.
kLab's funding comes from the Rwandan
government and foreign donors.
Jovani, Ntabgoba is the general manager at
KLAB.
>> Without kLAB [INAUDIBLE] we get people
from [INAUDIBLE].
Our success, we measure it when that
company, or that setup can
begin making money that can lets us move
out of our space.
So, with that, you're not really looking
at big sums of money.
Because they not looking at them, break
with them and work,
and be able to higher their own offices
and create jobs.
Maybe hire two or three more guys, because
as you
know developing countries already have a
very high number of unemployment.
So, whatever small an impact that we
cannot,
can make outside to us is considered an
achievement.
So that's the story.
>> Despite their short history, seed
accelerators have
grown rapidly worldwide in the span of
nine years.
The Silicon Valley model for seed
acceleration, is not feasible in
transitioning
economies, so government support and
donations
have provided alternative ways of
supporting entrepreneurs.
For this model to work in a transitioning
economy, governments and donors
are being asked to provide support
alongside private investors, to fund
accelerators.
It remains to be seen if the seed
accelerator model, will ultimately
be successful in helping transitioning
economies
develop and scale start up companies.
Eventually, investors in start up
companies
need to exit their investment, through
an acquisition or an IPO for there to be a
return on investment.
Time will tell if entrepreneurs in
Cleveland or Kigali
can create compelling enough start up
companies, and seed
accelerators to achieve even a fraction of
the financial
returns coming from the top accelerators
in Silicon Valley.
Some have commented there might be a seed
accelerator bubble,
given the rapid spread of the model across
the world.
Nevertheless, the spread of the model is a
good example of the type of creative
intervention
that transitioning economies are using, to
help young
entrepreneurs turn a business idea into a
company.
In the next lecture, we will look at what
transitioning economies are
doing to help encourage angel investment
through a variety of incentive programs.
See you next time.
