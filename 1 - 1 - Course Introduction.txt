My name is Michael Goldberg, and I'm a
Professor at the
Weatherhead School of Management at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland,
Ohio.
Welcome to Beyond Silicon Valley
Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning
Economies.
Thank you for making the time to take this
course.
I'm thrilled by the opportunity to have a
dialogue
with you about how to grow
entrepreneurship in transitioning economies.
In this first lecture, we're going to
discuss what this
course is about and what you can expect to
learn.
Let's get started.
In the upcoming lectures, we will examine
in
depth what I'm calling the Cleveland Case
Study.
In my home town of Cleveland, a massive
effort has been
undertaken over the past 10 years to
support the growth of entrepreneurship.
This was not done through private capital,
as is the
norm in Silicon Valley, but rather through
government and donor support.
Over the upcoming lectures, we'll be
looking in depth at this unique
approach to supporting an entrepreneurial
ecosystem
as it functions here in Northeast Ohio.
We'll also do some exploration on how it's
being done in other transitioning
economies around the world.
In this course, our lectures will contain
three consistent components.
First, we will start from the perspective
of an entrepreneur.
You will get an entrepreneur's view about
the topic at hand,
whether it be the role of government or
accessing angel investment.
Second, we will hear the perspective of
thought leaders from Cleveland's community
about how the region's strategy to support
entrepreneurs was devised and implemented.
And finally, we'll provide some
international context
as we learn from people around the world
about their experiences supporting
entrepreneurship when the private
sector alone is not providing the
necessary resources.
The lectures are just one part of the
course.
I'm also excited to learn from you about
the
dynamics and conditions for
entrepreneurship in your home community.
We'll do this through discussion boards,
assignments
and quizzes, interactive discussions, and
your final project.
And now a little more about Cleveland,
which will serve
as our springboard for examining the
support of entrepreneurial ecosystems.
Although Cleveland was struggling ten
years to
ago to launch start-up companies, a
hundred
years ago Cleveland was thriving and
considered
one of the most important U.S. cities.
Optimism abounded, and the city was home
to some of America's greatest businesses.
>> If we were to build a time machine and
go back to Cleveland in the
period 1910 to 1920 we, we'd find a
community that was extraordinarily
confident about its future.
Confident because its industrial
production was, was, was rising.
Confident because some of the businesses
here United
States Steel American Steel and Wire
Sherwin Williams, Glidden
Company Grasselli Chemical were among the
most powerful
businesses in the United States in leaders
and innovation.
The, nobody could foresee an end of that.
>> John Grabowski is a professor of
history at Case
Western Reserve University and author of
Encyclopedia of Cleveland History.
The world's most famous entrepreneur at
the time, John D
Rockefeller, started his business in
Cleveland in the 19th century.
>> If we were looking backwards in
Cleveland 100 years before today, we're
sitting
here in 2013, we're in probably the most
remarkable decade of the city's history.
1910, 1920, the, the city is going from
the sixth largest to the fifth largest
city in
the United States and, and it's impelled
in terms
of population by, by its creativity and
its industry.
And it's kind of what we call the
Rockefeller effect.
You know, in 1920, Cleveland's the fifth
largest city in the
United States and its industrial
production is the fifth most valuable.
And it gets to that level because during
the Gilded Age, in the decades leading
up to that, you have a number
of entrepreneurs, call them visionaries if
you want.
>> As the 20th century wore on,
Cleveland's Rockefeller magic disappeared.
>> Right now we're sitting in Cleveland,
the city of Cleveland, let's, let's, let's
exclude
metropolitan areas, now, the 47th largest
city in
the United States, was once the 5th
largest.
I think that juxtaposition of rank, really
astounds
people and, and the question is what
happened.
So the quiet crisis of 2000 is one aspect
of what happened, but by the 1950s,
Cleveland was, was beginning to lose it's,
it's, it's a lock on heavy industry.
Some historians will argue that, that
Cleveland
became so focused on heavy industry, on
traditional production that, that it lost
sight
of the need to create new disruptive
technologies.
Baiju Shah was working in the Cleveland
office of
the strategic consulting firm, McKinsey
and Company in 2002, on
a study that tried to identify what the
community
could do to dig itself out of the quiet
crisis.
>> And that's when we started looking at
the more fundamental realities of our
economic base, and realized that it, due
to globalization, and
a lack of reinvestment in new enterprises,
be they technology or non technology.
Well, our companies were thriving.
They we're thriving with less and less
local employment.
That forced, I think, the civic leaders to
say well, for 20 years we have been
focused perhaps on an incomplete solution
for, for revitalizing our region.
>> Jackie Acho was also on the McKinsey
team.
>> So in 2001 Northeast Ohio had suffered
a lot of blows.
We had lost several big companies, and
we weren't replacing those jobs with
anything new.
So we really had a lack of
entrepreneurship, and we had a declining
economy.
And you could really feel it everywhere.
>> Since the 1980's, Dorothy Baunach had
been
involved with technology based economic
development in Cleveland.
Baunach headed up a non-governmental
organization called NorTech, and was
a leading voice advocating for a new path
for economic growth.
>> We need entrepreneurs in an
entrepreneurial culture, and that was
something
that we had in the early 1900s, but by the
late 1900s
we were used to having big businesses and
milking cash cows for
all we could and we forgot about how to be
innovative and entrepreneurial.
And so you really had to instill that
culture back into the community.
>> Things hit an all time low as national
media outlets took notice of Cleveland's
lack of entrepreneurial activity.
>> Our rankings were bad, our companies
were
going away we didn't have much
entrepreneurial activity
at all, and we weren't even really sure
what we were supposed to do about it.
>> Cleveland's leaders wanted to revive
entrepreneurship in the region.
>> So in 2001, Entrepreneur Magazine
ranked us 61 out of
61 places, and that's really not where we
wanted to be.
We knew he, we had everything in place,
all the elements there to make us better,
but
we just had to figure out they way to do
it, the formula to do it better.
>> Brad Whitehead was another key player
on the McKinsey team tasked with
making recommendations to Cleveland's
community leaders on
how to move the local economy forward.
>> And I recall at the time there was this
great debate.
It was this chicken and egg debate about
well, is the problem that
we don't have capital or is the problem
that we don't have investable ideas.
And I think we thought, that is probably
an interesting intellectual discussion.
But probably the answer is, yes, we lack
capital and we lack investable
entrepreneurs investable ideas, so let's
get working on both at the same time.
>> So beginning around 2002, Cleveland
embarked on a
focused and huge undertaking to try to
grow entrepreneurship.
Since the market was not creating and
funding new companies in Cleveland
organically, the community looked to new
funding sources, primarily government and
philanthropy.
Ray Leach, a successful entrepreneur
originally from
the region who started and sold several
companies,
was recruited back to Cleveland to run
a newly created venture development
organization called JumpStart.
>> When I first got engaged in, in the
opportunity to be a part of this thinking
and this
acting, I thought this has absolutely no
chance of working
because Northeast Ohio, it's such
a predominantly manufacturing oriented
economy.
The people there don't get it.
They don't have the skills, and through a
series of conversations that I
ultimately convinced myself really because
of the passion and the vision that the
community had that, you know, maybe this
does have a chance, and it
is my home community, and you know, I'd
love to part of its evolution.
>> Bruce Katz from the Brookings
Instutution
in Washington, and the author of The
Metropolitan Revolution, looks at how
cities across
the U.S. try to grow their economy.
Katz' book was published in 2013
and examines Cleveland's intervention to
support entrepreneurship.
So what happened here was a group of very
smart philanthropies in particular the
Gund Foundation, the Cleveland Foundation
really began a process of, of intervening
in very smart and deliberate
ways in what really makes metropolitan
economies work.
Innovation, entrepreneurship,
manufacturing, trade, and, this
is one of the most successful network
models around the United States.
>> Katz also stresses the importance of
the role of government in transforming
Cleveland's economy.
In 2002, the state of Ohio implemented a
ground-breaking initiative called,
the Third Frontier, which is an
internationally-recognized,
government-funded, technology-based
economic development initiative.
>> I think the Third Frontier program was,
was very
important to provide the kind of
investment for technology firms.
In many respects, private capital hasn't
quite kept
pace with this, particularly in parts of
the
country which are perceived as places
where the,
you know, next economy has not come to
land.
So, the states do have to intervene when
you have this market failure, in a way.
>> Although Silicon Valley's famed
ecosystem developed over
time by benefiting from the support of
government and
donor resources, now the majority of
capital and support
for entrepreneurs there is coming from the
private sector.
In Cleveland and other transitioning
economies around the
world, government and donor resources are
being utilized
in partnership with the private sector to
try
to support the growth of new start-up
companies.
Cleveland's attempt to support the growth
of
entrepreneurship have been in place for
over
ten years, and it has certainly seen
some successes and certainly many ongoing
challenges.
The impact of entrepreneurship ser,
support programs is not felt overnight.
It takes years, if not decades, for
progress
to be made, even in places like Silicon
Valley.
Some of the key forces at work in
Cleveland that led to developing a more
entrepreneurial environment
include first, recognizing that there was
a crisis and
that something needed to be done to
address it.
Second, a coalition of strong community
leaders who were
passionate about making changes and
willing to work together.
Third, rapid creation and implementation
of a plan for the city and region.
Fourth, money and support from
philanthropic
and government organizations for new ideas
and
entities, like the Third Frontier and
Jumpstart
to grow an entrepeneurial mindset and
community.
During the upcoming lectures of the
course,
you will hear how this story unfolds.
How entrepreneurs include untapped into
the resources provided to grow
their fledgling companies, how the leaders
in the community dreamed
up and implemented these initiatives, and
importantly, we'll look at
how this has worked or differed in
communities around the world.
Upcoming lectures will cover government
involvement
and support of entrepreneurs, the role of
philanthropy, the creation of intermediary
organizations, the
role of anchor institutions in fostering
entrepreneurship.
Finally, we'll examine various initiatives
to provide
entrepreneurs capital and mentoring,
including development of
seed accelerators, promotion of angel
investment and
networks, and increasing access to venture
capital.
Thanks again for choosing to take this
course.
I look forward to all of us learning from
one another about how to
grow entrepreneurship in transitioning
economies.
See you next time.
