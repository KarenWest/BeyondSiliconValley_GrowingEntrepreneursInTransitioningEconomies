Hello again and welcome back to Beyond
Silicon Valley.
I'm Michael Goldberg.
In previous lectures, we've discussed
government support for
entrepreneurship, the role of philanthropy
and intermediary organizations.
This week, we'll explore ways to leverage
Anchor Institutions.
Some key points you'll learn about are,
supporting increased
commercialization activity, licensing
versus new
company formation and measuring success.
Cleveland, like many communities around
the world, is fortunate
to have outstanding research institutions
including universities and hospitals.
My home university Case Western Reserve
attracts
over $400 million each year in research
funding.
And the region is also home to several
other strong research universities such as
Cleveland State, the University of Akron
and Kent State just to name a few.
The Cleveland Clinic is the number one
ranked hospital in the world for
cardiovascular disease.
And University Hospitals is another
leading
health care provider in our region.
10 years ago Cleveland's anchor
institutions were struggling to
translate their research into commercially
viable technologies or companies.
There was not a culture of
entrepreneurship, or was
their a vibrant system for creating,
promoting, or nurturing innovation.
Institutions were focused on licensing
their technologies
to large corporations, typically outside
the region.
Rather than creating local startup
companies.
New initiatives, funded by the Third
Frontier and donors,
focused on strengthening the
commercialization process at key
institutions.
As a result, the pace of new company
formation increased.
In this lecture, we will discuss how
communities can work with their anchor
institutions.
To link their engines of innovation, such
as universities, to
a connected web of support that includes
entrepreneurs, investors, and talent.
The combination of political will, a long
view, and
investment capital can improve the
pipeline of start up companies.
Dave Neundorfer is the CEO of LineStream
Technologies LineStream Technologies is an
embedded software company.
And we are changing the way that automated
products are
controlled by delivering easy to
use software that delivers advanced
performance.
>> LineStream's technology was buried in a
research lab for 12 years, until a
venture capitalist, backed with investment
capital from
the State of Ohio, and several
foundations.
Provided the resources of mentoring and
management talent
to turn it into a stand alone startup
company.
>> LineStream spun out of Cleveland State
University in 2008.
I believe we were if not the first, one of
the first spin out companies that they,
that they had.
And the catalyst for this spin out was
actually a business planning competition.
Where the Professor Dr. Zhiqiang Gao who
had been leading about 10 to 12 years of
research in the space, put together a
presentation
to show how, his technology could apply to
industry.
And how they could potentially build
business around it
in our current investors happened to be in
the audience.
For that meeting, the stars aligned.
They were able to meet and discuss the
blueprint for taking it, out
of the research realm at CSU, and
beginning it on the path towards
commercialization.
For decades it was well understood that
universities and
hospitals were developing innovative ideas
and cutting edge research.
But turning this into a pipeline of
independent high growth companies was a
struggle.
Frank Samuel, the state of Ohio's former
Science and Technology
Advisor, explains why the Third Frontier
focused on this opportunity.
Well the institutions are important for
two reasons.
One is that they create intellectual
property through their research, and
they're the
source of highly qualified individuals,
often young
individuals who can contribute to
entrepreneurial enterprise.
Jackie Acho, then a McKinsey partner
working
on the regional strategy to support
entrepeneurship, recalls
why their recommendations pushed for
Cleveland to
try to take better advantage of its
university.
>> We really wanted to create a pathway
through which technological ideas coming
out of universities or.
From, you know, people in businesses who
wanted to
go off on their own, could find uh,a
market,
and a place to get capital, and some
support
to be able to start their company and grow
it.
>> Baiju Shah, former CEO of Bio
Enterprise argues that in the past the
region had not appropriately invested in
the
commercialization of technology out of the
Institution.
One of the clear strengths that we had.
That we have probably under invested in,
from an economic development
perspective, was our region's great
clinical and research institutions, in
healthcare.
We are known in the United States for...
Our political institutions.
They're considered to be among the best in
the country.
We've got a great research university that
has
a whole host of research but in spite of
that, unlike, again, other regions where
similar ingredients existed,
we hadn't seen the growth of our
healthcare economy.
The products and services that supply
those types of institutions
and, ultimately, supply institutions
across the country and the world.
Why were Cleveland's leading institutions
struggling
to turn their research into new company.
Steven Girouard was formerly a Vice
President of
Johnson and Johnson's Corporate Office of
Science and Technology.
>> Why don't universities do a great job
of commercializing technology.
It's really not their expertise.
You know, they're great at educating.
They're great at publishing papers and
writing grants and getting.
Basic research funded but they really are
not good at design and wrapping
business models around designs that will
be successful in the in the real world.
>> An example of Cleveland's attempt to
change the velocity of commercialization
activity coming
out of the institutions was the creation
of the Global Cardiovascular Innovation
Center or GCIC.
housed at the Cleveland Clinic.
The GCIC was funded by a grant from the
third
frontier matched with investment from
institution partners, including the
Cleveland Clinic.
Mark Low, GCIC's executive director,
provides an overview.
>> Step back a minute, GCIC was formed
with a very generous.
$60 million grant from the state of Ohio
to establish the organization.
And of that roughly half is dedicated to
in turn
provide support to new technology
development and new company formation.
>> Charu Ramanathan's CardioInsight whose
technology was
developed in a lab at Case Western Reserve
University.
With one of the companies that benefited
from GCIC's grants.
>> So, so the another vehicle that we use
state funded money, is, GCIC.
So, the GCIC and the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, it
was right on because we were
cardiovascular innovative technology.
So we actually develop three different
clinical applications in heart failure, in
catheter
navigations signalling the location of the
catheter
which is a very important clinical impact.
As well as building our first commercial
software.
All of these three key aspects of the
product were developed with money invested
through the GCIC.
>> Although some start up companies grab
the headlines
for how quickly they are able to scale and
grow.
Most early stage companies, particularly
those in
the medical industry, take many years to
develop.
Mark Low argues the grants that the GCIC
provides, help
companies like CardioInsight survive,
until private funding is secured.
>> So the financing continuum or resources
for any particular
technology Has become a multi step, multi
source
process that spans a development timeline
of biomedical products
of anywhere from three to five to 10
years.
So it's a long process, requires
significant.
Amounts of funding and a continuum of
availability
of that funding to move the products
forward.
Well that leaves the very early stage
technologies without much support.
>> Joe Jankowski Case Western Reserve's
Chief Innovation Officer, describes why he
believes that Cardio Insight made
investment sense as a spin off company.
>> Cardio Insight was really a technology
that had existed a
case for almost a decade prior to the
company being created.
And the company was created by two
students, who then were still working on
their
PhDs in the lab of the original, inventor,
and realized that there was value here.
The thing that made it easy to consider it
a local spin off was, was two factors.
One is, it couldn't go to a large company,
the Medtronic for Johnson and Johnson, it
was too
early, there was too much technical risk,
so it
wasn't as though we had a tough choice to
make.
The second reason was, because it's early
stage
um,developments, commercial development
would need to be, in the
field of what we call clinical translation
of getting
that sort of first in man study of the
term.
We had one of the worlds great, you know,
cardiology sectors here in Cleveland.
>> Since private companies such as Johnson
& Johnson
tend to only invest in companies that are
more well
established, Steve Girouard sees the
importance that government programs
like The Third Frontier, filling the early
stage capital gap.
>> So The Third Frontier and programs like
it are, I think are really important.
They're organized in a way that can really
make an impact.
First of all, they're substantial in terms
of their size, the total
magnitude of financial resources put
behind
that program are, can make a difference.
They're also Have a long view, which I
think is really critical for programs like
this.
>> Bruce Katz of the Brookings
Institution, believes that Northeast Ohio
has
acted wisely by trying to leverage the
strength of its Innovative Institutions.
>> So, Northeast Ohio is really fortunate
to have this network of advanced research
institutions, medical campuses, that are
really at the cutting edge of innovation.
They're service institutions right?
They're teaching the next generation of
workers, students, I mean leaders.
They're providing health care, but they're
also very innovative.
Right, they're at the next stage of
biotech, biomed,
and cracking the code on a wide range of
diseases.
And that plays itself out, into
the private sector as we commercialize
Innovation.
>> Brad Whitehead, of The Fund for Our
Economic Future, concurs with
Katz, about trying to harness the
innovation of anchor institutions to boost
entrepreneurship.
>> Anchor institutions sit at the
foundation of most economic development
strategies of regions around the country
and frankly around the world.
Part of the kind of, well recognized
reason for that is that is because they're
a source of ideas, a source of talent a
source of innovation and so forth.
One of the, I think unsung roles that our
anchor
institutions in Northeast Ohio have
played has, it's provided us.
The foundation for which we can also serve
the rest of the region.
>> Communities outside the U.S. face many
of the same challenges we have
heard about in Cleveland regarding how
to commercialize research from their
leading institutions.
Chris Zobrist is a professor at the
Vietnman National University.
>> Until now, I think most government
research institutes
and haven't had that much interaction in
terms of commerce.
I think most of the research so far that's
come out is largely driven by
Government Initiatives and whatever the
professors in the
university could, could get [SOUND]
Government sponsorship for.
And typically it wasn't that marketed
oriented.
>> Yi Zhang is a venture capitalist with
Kaiwu Capital in China.
Compared to the university in US.
They're still not very good at converting
R&D into real commercial available
product.
I know recently, they've been spending
lots of effort in that direction.
Every university has a patent office.
And help with tech IP, and also give you
specific instruction on how you can
commercialize this part.
>> In Cleveland and other communities
around the world anchor institutions
are trying to translate their research
strengths into commercial viable entities.
Ultimately the private market determines
the commercial success of a technology.
The ability of companies like CardioInsight and
LineStream Technologies to raise private
venture capital financing.
Validates the initial investment by
government
and donors in the commercialization
process.
As with other forms of early stage
investment the final measurement
of success and support will be determined
over the long term.
With the necessary support, anchor
institutions
are showing the ability to leverage
their ideas and talent, instead of letting
them gather dust in lab.
Success is measured in terms of the number
of startup
companies launched, the amount of outside
private capital raised, the
creation of good local jobs, and
ultimately, revenue back to
the institution after an exit event or
through licensing fee.
That's it for this lecture of Beyond
Silicon Valley.
In the next lecture, we'll focus on the
emergence of Seed Accelerators
and how government and donors support
is fueling their growth and transitioning
economy.
See you next time.
