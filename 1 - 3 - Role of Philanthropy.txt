Hello again, and welcome back to Beyond
Silicon Valley.
I'm Michael Goldberg.
In the last lecture, we talked about
government support for entrepreneurship.
In this lecture, we'll explore the role
of philanthropy and donors in supporting
entrepreneurs.
Some key points you'll learn about are why
donors get involved
in supporting entrepreneurs, how donors
may
differ from government and private
investors
in terms of the expectations of the
organizations they support, and
the challenges of maintaining donor
interest
in entrepreneurship over the long haul.
Let's get started.
US law allows individuals or corporations
to donate money
to nonprofit organizations without paying
taxes on the money.
Often times, these donations are channeled
through foundations.
Because of Cleveland's economic strength,
built
on the back of entrepreneurs like John
Rockefeller in the 1920s and 1930s,
several
large foundations were created in the
city.
One of these foundations, the Cleavland
Foundation, was
the first community foundation in the
United States.
For years, these foundations supported and
protected Cleveland's artistic treasures,
such as the Cleveland Orchestra and the
Cleveland Museum of Art.
They had not traditionally focused on
economic development.
However, this changed in the early 1980s
when Cleveland's
economy was suffering with the decline of
its manufacturing base.
In 2002, the government of Ohio started
to support entrepreneurship with the
creation of
the Third Frontier Program, which we
looked at in depth in our last lecture.
Around the same time the Third Frontier
Program was launched, a number of
leading foundations in northeast Ohio
decided to
pool resources for economic development
and entrepreneurship.
The foundations called this new initiative
the Fund for Our Economic Future, and
it was a philanthropic collaboration
program that
was truly unique in the United States.
David Levine, the founder of Wireless
Environment, is
one such entrepreneur whose company
benefited from philanthropic funding.
In 2008, Wireless Environment received a
$400,000 investment from Jump Start, a
local
venture development organization funded by
donors and
the state of Ohio's Third Frontier
Program.
David notes the impact that foundations
in Cleveland have had in backing
entrepreneurs.
>> At Wireless Environment, we're taking
lighting off the grid.
So we're, we have two types of products.
The Mr. Beams lights that are
fully off-grid lights, battery-powered,
motion-sensing lights.
And then we have devices that we can put
in traditional lighting
that will take the lights on and off the
grid when it's advantageous.
Think of a laptop but for lighting.
What I've noticed in Cleveland being a
newcomer, of
sorts, foundations that traditionally
invested in big, staples of the
community such as the, the art museum and,
and the Cleveland
Orchestra, are also investing in the
entrepreneurial infrastructure.
And they're doing that through Jump Start
and
other, other organizations that are
private and public.
It does a few things.
It gives credibility to these
organizations
that are trying to foster this foundation.
It's also putting it in the same realm as,
something that is
for the public good, such as an orchestra
or an art museum.
>> Dorothy Baunach, the former CEO of
Nortech, believes that it is
a challenge to convince foundations to
invest in entrepreneurs like David Levine.
>> We have a wonderful orchestra, and we
have a wonderful art museum.
And we have all these things that make a
wonderful community.
But if we didn't have jobs for people, and
investment, in
those jobs and in those companies, we
weren't going to survive.
There would be, you know, no one left to
go to the art museum or hear a wonderful
orchestra.
So the foundations actually recognized
that sometime in the early 80s, really at
the, really taking the lead of the
business community that said, you know
what?
We had, at one time we had over 25 Fortune
500
companies in this community, and now we're
down to 10 or 12.
And if we don't do something about it,
we're going to be the next one to leave.
>> Founded in 1914, the Cleveland
Foundation is
the largest community foundation in the
United States.
Ronn Richard is the president and CEO.
>> So the Cleveland Foundation is unique
in a lot of ways, but one thing
that's unique about us is our role in
the economy in Cleveland, in funding
economic development.
So for most of the first 100 years we did
what most community foundations do these
days, which is funding the arts, social
services, and, and things like that.
But we were really the first community
foundation, and still
one of the very few, that felt that, you
know, heck,
if we don't do something about the
economy, we won't
have an art museum to give money to in 30
years.
>> The Cleveland Foundation helped start
the unique Fund for Our Economic Future.
Support of the growth of entrepreneurship
was one
of the key focus areas of the fund.
Brad Whitehead leads the Fund for Our
Economic Future.
>> It is the philanthropic's communities
response to
the long term economic challenges, facing
northeast Ohio.
And so we have some 50 plus members, who
pooled their resources, both financial, in
terms of their
time and such, to work on the economic
vibrancy
of our region through grant-making,
convening, and sponsoring research.
And we do that in collaboration with all
the other sectors in the community.
>> Cleveland used to rely on its corporate
leaders
to drive economic prosperity and jobs for
the region.
As these companies moved away,
philanthropy
provided important leadership to fill the
void.
>> And if we think about the history of
how economic
development has occurred in, greater
Cleveland and northeast Ohio, the old
formula had always been, well, let's climb
on the backs of
the large corporate leaders and expect
them to provide the answer.
But I think we've come to realize that
that model
on its own won't be successful in the same
way.
Power is dif, more diffuse now, it's not
just
in a core city, it's in an entire region.
It's not just in the corporate sector,
it's in the entrepreneurial sector as
well.
It's not just in the business sector, it's
spread to a bunch of other groups.
>> What really galvanized the
philanthropic
community and led them to take action?
Dorothy Baunach credits the Third
Frontier's requirement that there
be an outside match in order to access its
funding.
>> So, match and all-state programs, was
essential.
The state wasn't going to put money into
things, especially early-stage
risky things, if the communities weren't
willing to invest with them.
It was right about the time of the
Third Frontier that the foundations were
thinking about getting
their own scale, in terms of investment in
entrepreneurship
and innovation, that the Third Frontier
was coming along.
>> The Burton D.
Morgan Foundation has been pivotal in the
building the region's
entrepreneurial ecosystem, supporting the
startup
community, and experiential
entrepreneurship education.
A legacy of entrepreneur Burton D.
Morgan, the foundation leverages its
resources to build networks of people,
ideas, organizations, and opportunities
that foster
the entrepreneurial spirit in the region.
Deborah Hoover serves as the CEO of the
Foundation
and as chair of the Fund for Our Economic
Future.
>> It's been a, you know, a really
aggressive match requirement on the part
of the state of Ohio for our
local economic development organizations
to access those dollars.
But at the end of the day, that's been a
really good thing
because the dollars coming from the state
invested in you know, high-tech startups.
And in the services to, you know, to
bolster those high-tech startups.
It's, it's significant.
>> Donors tend to be more patient than the
private
sector and government in seeing
their investments in entrepreneurship bear
fruit.
Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution
believes that
the patience of local philanthropy has
benefited northeast Ohio.
>> I think metropolitan economies are
ecosystems.
I mean, you know, in the United States we
tend to focus on the celebrity
entrepreneur, or the charismatic mayor,
and the
way in which metropolitan economies
actually prosper is
through these thick ecosystems and
networks of
advanced research institutions and large
companies and small
entrepreneurs and investors and
institutions that can help
train workers and help firms strengthen
their business
plans, retool their facilities.
Former BioEnterprise CEO Baiju Shah echoes
Katz's point of view about
philanthropy's willingness to take a
long-term
view regarding their support of
entrepreneurship.
>> I think you have a real challenge in,
in economic development in sustaining
investment and strategies to
the point where they have not only proven
themselves,
but they can become self-sustaining
elements of a region.
In our case, you've got multiple actors.
You've got government, you've got
foundations in philanthropy,
and you've also got the business slash
civic leadership.
Government can never be the place where
you look to for sustained investment in
a strategy because of the short timeframes
in which they operate, due to election
cycles.
>> Brad Whitehead asserts that even though
philanthropic
support has its advantages, there is
another challenge.
That of keeping donors engaged, and
avoiding a syndrome known as donor
fatigue.
>> Now one of the greatest advantages of
philanthropy
is that we can take the long view of
issues.
But like everyone else in the world is
that it,
it, it's tiring to stay with something for
so long.
And we know that this is work that takes
decades, but we find that a big part of
our
task is to keep it evolving and to keep
it interesting, so that everyone wants to
hang with it.
>> While foundations in northeast Ohio had
been extremely
patient with entrepreneurship programs,
Peter Kellner, cofounder of Endeavor,
an international organization that
supports high-growth entrepreneurship,
argues that
this is not true with philanthropists from
around the world.
>> Traditional philanthropy is still very
broken.
It believes, it's run by bureaucrats, who
are box checkers.
Who are, essentially, the metaphor is they
like to water a gar, water a garden.
And when something starts growing they're
like oh, it's growing.
Let's go somewhere else.
What do the best venture capitalists do?
And that's how you've got to think about
it if
you're a philant, if, you know,
philanthropist or an investor.
You got to think like a venture
capitalist.
>> Philanthropy is a source of support for
entrepreneurs outside the US.
However, philanthropy or donations come
from sources other than foundations
internationally.
These philanthropic sources typically
include
foreign governments through their
development
assistance programs, non-governmental
organizations, often
abbreviated as NGOs, and corporate
donations.
Chris Zobrist, from Vietnam National
University, believes it is a
major challenge to entice donors to
support entrepreneurship in Vietnam.
>> There are a few angel investors who
actually do have that more philanthropic,
kind of bent.
You know, they want to, in some ways, give
back to, the community or the society, but
they're very reluctant to step forward
and, and,
and actually, actively, engage in that
kind of, activity.
Largely because they're worried that if
they step forward and start putting money,
you know, very prominently into new
startups, the, the, various parts of
the government, it's highly political,
here, will, will take notice of that
and say, hey, you know, where did you get
all this money from?
>> Okay, that's it for this lecture.
To recap, the Cleveland case study shows
how leveraging government support
played a key role in getting donors to
fund entrepreneurial initiatives.
In other cases, donors worked
independently from local
governments to help foster the creation of
startup companies.
One important point we learned about
donors as investors is they
are generally more patient than
private-sector
or government backers of startup
companies.
But even donors can have their limits.
And it is still challenging to keep them
engaged when
the results of their funding are often
best measured over decades.
What has been unique about Cleveland is
the ability of many
foundations and other entities to pool
their resources and act together.
This takes strong leadership and trust
from all parties involved.
In our next lecture, we'll be focusing on
the
formation of intermediary organizations to
deliver support to entrepreneurs.
These organizations are typically
non-governmental or non-profit
organizations.
Jump Start, the venture development
organization we have discussed in
Cleveland, will be featured in the next
lecture as an example.
See you next time.
