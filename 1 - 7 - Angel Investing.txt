Hello again and welcome back to Beyond
Silicon Valley.
In previous lectures, we've discussed
government support for entrepreneurship,
the
role of philanthropy, intermediary
organizations,
anchor institutions and seed accelerators.
This time we'll explore angel investing.
Some key points you'll learn about are who
are angel investors and what motivates
them to invest, the structure of angel
funds, and government incentives for angel
investors.
Well the emergence of [INAUDIBLE]
Accelerators is providing
some access to initial seed capitol and
mentoring.
Entrepreneurs often find they need
additional
investment to grow and scale their
business.
Angel Investors are not family member and
often have
never met the entrepreneur before hearing
their pitch for investment.
Silicon Valley has generated scores of
successful and extremely wealthy
entrepreneurs who
want to use their wealth to invest in
other new start up companies.
They often do this either individually or
through organized Angel Funds.
In transitioning economies, convincing
wealthy individuals to
become angel investors can be a challenge.
Investing in startup companies is
inherently risky.
According to a study by the Kauffman
Foundation, only 35%
of startup companies in the US survive
beyond 10 years.
Given these statistics, it is no wonder
that wealthy people who are primarily
interested in preserving their wealth, may
not be interested in becoming angel
investors.
To address this, leaders in Ohio
introduced several
programs in 2004 to stimulate angel
investment, including
a tax credit for angel investments and
matching
funding to incentivize the formation of
new angel funds.
Tom Lix is an experienced entrepreneur who
moved to Cleveland to start Cleveland
Whiskey.
>> We are the only whiskey company in
the world, that does just in time
manufacturing of
whiskey sort of like Dell computers in the
80s or 90s or when they were coming out.
We make a product that tastes as good if
not better than a lot
of the traditional products, but we make
it in a fraction of the time.
We've got some advanced technology that
does that.
>> In order to raise capital from Angel
investors, Lix
spent a lot of time networking among folks
in Cleveland.
>> I just networked and I talked to people
and I, I looked for people.
You know the advantage for me is I've got
a whiskey company, and
so it was easy for me to sort of start
conversations in that area.
I wrote a business plan, did all the right
things that
a, you know, that an entrepreneur has to
do to attract investors.
And then did the traditional networking,
and, you know the good
news is people are willing to introduce
you to other people here.
I think that was a big part of it.
People are certainly willing to talk and
willing
to take chances and willing to take some
risks.
>> While Tom Lix successfully raised
capital from
angel investors for Cleveland Whiskey in
2013, he
would have struggled to find angels in
Cleveland
willing to invest in his company 10 years
prior.
There was virtually no local angel
investment at that time.
To address the dearth of angel fuding, the
Ohio Third Frontier introduced its
Pre-Seed Capitalization Program.
In this program, matching funding is
offered to private investors
who commit to invest through an organized
angel investment fund.
Frank Samuel, the former science and
technology adviser for the state of Ohio,
believes it was important for the Third
Frontier to put this initiative in place.
>> Here in Ohio we saw that the angel
investors
were a very promising pool of financial
capital that could
be brought to bear on early stage
companies and the,
companies at the very beginning stages of,
of, operation and growth.
Consequently we made a limited amount of
money available to what we call angel
networks.
>> John Houston, the founder of the Ohio
Tech Angel Funds, believes that
the third frontier match funding had a
real impact on fostering angel investment.
>> All of the angel groups in Ohio,
I think have benefited from the Ohio Third
Frontier
because their money, really is the honey
to
attract particularly first time new angels
off the sidelines.
It's the match which provides leverage
which means it's financially beneficial
for them
to join established angel groups the,
which
have benefited from high third tier
programs.
>> In addition to providing matching
investment
dollars to angel funds through the preseed
capitalization
program, the Ohio Third Frontier also
provided
support for Angel Funds to hire
professional management.
Angel investor Morris Wheeler believes
this was critical.
An Angel Fund by definition is not going
to be
able to economically support, paying
people of the
quality necessary to, to run a good angel
fund.
That's why most angels organize into
groups and don't have funds.
I think without some sort of public
support
of the management infrastructure, the
angel
fund as we know it in Cleveland probably
would not exist at all.
>> Mike Belsito believes that angel tax
credit was a
motivating factor in attracting wealthy
individuals to invest in eFuneral.
>> From a state level, there's also a
program that
Ohio released which is the Ohio Technology
Investment tax credit.
And essentially what it did was it allowed
angel investors to recoup some of their
initial investment in equity based
companies in, in the form of a tax credit.
And I would say it was a big deal when we
were first talking to angel investors.
It was really a necessity from their end
that
we were approved for the Ohio technology
investment tax credit.
>> John Houston stresses the impact of the
tax credit on
helping him recruit angel investors for
the Ohio Tech angel funds.
>> One of the reasons it was easy back in
2004 to organize the Ohio Tech Angels with
their first fund is because we explained
to our
members how the Ohio Technology Investment
tax credit worked.
Which really enabled them to have a 25%
tax credit against their Ohio
state income taxes for every dollar that
they invested in a startup.
>> Government support of angel investing
in Cleveland helps alleviate
some of the inherent risk in investing in
startup companies.
In addition to providing capital, many
angel investors are attracted to the
opportunity to mentor the entrepreneurs
and
see job growth in their own communities.
>> I find at least as I travel around
talking to angels that,
that the number one driving force is to
really help their innovation economy.
It really is to identify and mentor the
most
promising entrepreneurs in your local area
and nothing is as
exciting as If you can, can find a, a
great
idea, with a great leader who can build a
team.
>> Angel investors tend to understand that
most start-up companies will fail and
those that are successful can take over a
decade to return their capital.
So given those odds, what exactly
motivates
Angels to invest in start-up companies at
all?
>> In the case of deals that I look in in
my home
community which I consider to be Ohio in
general and Northeast Ohio in particular.
I will give a little bit more latitude for
the fact that
I think, I want to give back to the
community by supporting companies.
I would never invest in investments, that
I wasn't convinced
was going to have the potential to be
really huge.
Because when I invest in a company that
means I am going to devote time and
effort.
And I'm going to vouch for that founding
team to other people that I invest with.
And I can't afford to risk my reputation
on a deal I don't believe in.
>> Cleveland has made slow, but steady
progress in building its base of angel
investors.
The North Coast Angel Fund in Cleveland
formed in 2007 has
99 members and has invested $14 million in
35 portfolio companies.
Angel investors from the fund have also
invested an additional $16 million in the
funds portfolio companies, which are known
as side car investments.
In 2013, over half the 118 companies in
northeast Ohio
that raised capital received an investment
from an Angel investor.
Let's take a look at what's happening
outside of Cleveland in other
transitioning economies.
For many entrepreneurs around the world,
convincing wealthy individuals
to invest outside of their own family has
been difficult.
John Houston argues that there's a
difference
between angel investing in the U.S. and
internationally.
>> Here, we tend to be really excited
about
the idea much more than from where it
came.
And it certainly is not focused solely on
family members and close friends.
If I had to, with my small family, limit
my investments to just
my family I could probably count them on
one hand over my entire lifetime.
Internationally there is a proclivity to
really stay with blood relatives
that sometimes is difficult because they
all live sometimes closely
and you don't see the larger geographic
dispersion of deal flow.
>> Angel Investing remains an unfamiliar
concept for
people in some international markets as
Jeff Hoffman,
a founder and CEO in the priceline.com
family
of companies, found during a recent trip
to Algeria.
>> While I was on a trip to Algeria, some
successful wealthy Algerian businessmen,
I, I gave them that speech.
The next day, they came to me all excited
and said, we did it.
We formed an Algerian business angel or,
organization and we want to celebrate.
So we went out to dinner.
They had champagne.
They had little business angel shirts
made.
And we we're having a really nice dinner
and later in the
evening the guy that hosted the dinner and
created the business angel
network pulled me aside and said can I ask
you a question
and kind of looked both ways, whispered in
my ear, and I said sure.
And he said what do we do now?
And I thought it was hilarious and I said
what do you mean what we do now?
And he said we're not entirely sure what a
business angel does but we are one now.
So, I loved the enthusiasm and they
weren't really sure what to do next.
And we were able to connect them to some
business angel networks.
Invited them to the states to sit in on
some
business angel network monthly meetings so
they can get it right.
But I love their spirit of forming
something
and then asking what it was supposed to
be.
>> While I was in Turkey recently, I had
the chance to learn how the Turkish
government started a new initiative to
encourage the
formation of angel networks through a tax
credit.
Hakan Ertuk, the head of financial
instrument
and market development at the Turkish
Treasury explains.
>> As the government we make a law that
say
after 2014, Angels, Los Angeles, should
apply via netverse to get the
tax credit, so they have to apply
for the Angels netverse If from is
enterprise network,
to, to open everywhere in Turkey.
So Angel networks get benefit of this.
>> So to recap we've seen how many
communities around the world are
starting to promote Angel Investment
through programs
like tax credit or matching investment
funds.
These programs can create a culture
of local investment that didn't previously
exist.
And angel investors are interested in
promoting
entrepreneurship and job growth in their
own backyard.
They want to see success at home.
But these interests come second to their
primary goal of return on their
investment.
And we've learned some of the potential
pitfalls that angel investors face.
Success can be very slow in coming.
For example, the North Coast Angel One
based on Cleveland has invested in 35
companies since its founding in 2007 and
is still waiting for its first exit.
Early stage investing can take tremendous
patience.
Second, it is often times difficult to
convince the
government organization to continue its
support of angel investment initiatives.
I mentioned earlier an Angel tax credit in
Ohio that helped incentivize angels.
That tax credit has now expired and it is
not clear if political leaders will
support its renewal.
That's it for this lecture.
Next time we will look at venture capital,
another form of early stage financing.
See you next time.
