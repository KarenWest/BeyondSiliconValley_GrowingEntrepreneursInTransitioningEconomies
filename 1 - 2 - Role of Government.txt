Welcome back to Beyond Silicon Valley, I'm
Michael Goldberg.
In this lecture we're going to explore
the role of government in supporting
entrepreneurs.
We'll look at how this was done in Ohio,
and focus on these key questions.
What kind of initiatives should government
support?
And how does it justify its investments?
Why should governments get involved in
supporting entrepreneurship at all?
Isn't it best to let the private sector
handle investing
in private companies directly since this
is what they do best?
In 2002, Entrepreneur Magazine ranked
Cleveland dead last
in its annual U.S. ranking of friendliness
to entrepreneurs.
But it wasn't as though the State of Ohio
government didn't
have any programs in place to support
entrepreneurship at that time.
They did, but the programs were small and
disorganized
and they weren't making a dent in the
problem.
It was critical juncture for the region.
Northeast Ohio needed to grow new
companies and
add jobs in a much more significant way.
It needed a way to support entrepreneurs
and
encourage them to start new businesses in
the region.
Charu Ramanathan is the co-founder of the
medical device company CardioInsight.
Charu believes that a new source of
government
funding in Ohio played an important role
in bringing
the technology she developed in a lab at
Case
Western Reserve University into a
full-fledged independent start-up company.
>> CardioInsight is developing a novel
3D mapping technology for mapping cardiac
disorders.
About 10% of our financing over our money
that we've raised to date comes from state
vehicles.
So one of the vehicles that's really
enabling is state financing.
Because if your project is sound, and
you're able to articulate exactly what
you're
going to do in paper, in their format, and
it's credible, you get the money.
>> To address the dire lack of support for
entrepreneurs and create a nurturing
environment for fledgling companies,
the government of the state of Ohio
stepped in
and introduced a program in 2002, called
the Third Frontier.
The Third Frontier was envisioned to
provide financial support in key sectors
where
Ohio possessed strengths relative to the
rest of the United States and the world.
But to work, it had to be big.
Much bigger than the trickle of
uncoordinated
minor programs that had been previously
available.
Ohio voters ultimately approved over 2.3
billion dollars in funding for this
program.
Charu argues that the support from the
Third Frontier kept her company in
Cleveland.
If we hadn't been able to do that, and we
had to purely do this,
you know, based on private financing, we,
we
would have have to move out of Cleveland.
>> Government support for entrepreneurship
was new and would present challenges.
Government officials, unlike their
counterparts
in the private sector, lacked experience
in selecting companies for investment that
would be successful in the market.
The State of Ohio addressed this by doing
two key things.
First, it required companies to find other
investors to match the government grants.
Second, the government would require third
party
independent evaluators to make
recommendations for allocation.
Frank Samuel was the Science and
Technology Advisor to Ohio
Governor Robert Taft, who launched the
innovative Third Frontier Program.
>> The Ohio Third Frontier Program was
created about ten or 11 years
ago because the then-governor Bob Taft
felt that there was a need
for a significant program to support
innovation in the Ohio economy.
>> Lisa Delp was the former Executive
Director of the Third Frontier.
>> The Third Frontier
came out of the, the, the desperation and
the need to make change.
And a lot of regions in Ohio were looking
for ways to make change.
And, and at the same time, the Third
Frontier was really launching, Northeast
Ohio was coming
together as a unit with a, a single voice
and a single mission and, and goal.
>> Dorothy Baunach, the former CEO of
NorTech,
was a key proponent of getting the
government of
the state of Ohio, which is based in
Columbus,
to play a more active role in funding
entrepreneurship.
>> The regular investors, that the risk is
too high for
any one investor to vet, to invest on one
technology startup.
You really need a pool of money and you
need some additional incentives.
So the Third Frontier really became that
extra incentive.
>> Rebecca Bagley, another leader in the
entrepreneurship community in Cleveland,
believes that the scale of The Third
Frontier program was critical.
Third Frontier is an extremely unique
program across the country.
For one thing, it's at scale.
So it's a very large program when in
comparison to other states.
There's only a handful of other states who
have programs that large.
It's also been sustained program.
So we've been able to sustain that level
of funding for almost the last ten years.
>> Another of the challenges for
government programs is trying to narrowly
define
the type of startup company that offers
the community the greatest opportunity for
growth.
>> So, we said we wanted high growth
entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs whose companies would be,
you know, worth
millions of dollars, in the years to come.
That might represent an opportunity for an
exit for the
entrepreneur that they could then reinvest
in the, in other start-ups.
>> And how do you decide which companies
to fund?
To address this question, the Third
Frontier program has a number of
requirements,
the first being that government funds must
be matched by another funding source.
Richard Seaman, a private business leader
in
Ohio, sits on the Third Frontier
commission.
Well, virtually every program that's been
designed through the Ohio Third Frontier
requires
matching dollars, and, those matching
dollars
can come in, in many different ways.
What this does is provides additional
screening to the quality
of the grantees in the programs that are
out there.
>> In addition to the matching
requirement, the Third Frontier requires
that
all of the applications for funding be
evaluated by an independent third party.
This requirement brings high standards of
professionalism, transparency, and
independence into grant making.
Lisa Delp explains how this helps
remove favoritism from the decision making
process.
>> In the constitutional language that
governs the Third Frontier, they wrote
in that awards have to be made based on a
third party evaluation.
So, someone from the outside has to be
contracted to look at a
proposal that's structured around a
request
for proposals in a very measured manner.
>> Okay.
So, the government program is up and
running.
But how do you know it's working?
Worthy companies are vetted, selected, and
are receiving money.
But how do you measure success?
What metrics do you use?
>> Job creation as a metric tends to be
first top of mind for everybody, I think.
If you're going to make these investments,
you're doing it to grow the economy.
You're doing it to grow the economy to
create jobs.
Part of the problem with that metric today
is that a
lot of these investments improve the
productivity of a particular person.
So I think in addition to looking at what
the,
what the job creation numbers are from a
quantity standpoint,
you also have to look at the quality of
the
jobs and how much revenue is an individual
job creating.
>> So to measure the success of the Third
Frontier programs to support
entrepreneurship,
three key metrics are considered.
Job creation, tax revenue, and the amount
of follow-on
capital that is raised by entrepreneurs
after the state investment.
There is a spirited debate about the
extent
to which government should be involved in
supporting entrepreneurship.
Ray Leach of Jump Start explains
why governmental intervention was
important in Cleveland.
>> One could take an approach, whether
it's an NGO or a community
that says, we want to keep public sector
dollars completely out of this.
And that could be a reasonable approach,
but
in our experience the public sector
dollars have been
able, have enabled us to create a lot
of momentum in a relatively short amount
of time.
If you get the right private sector
leadership and you get everybody
organized, and they're committed for 20
years, you can make a significant
difference.
Ohio didn't have 20 years.
>> David Liddle is a Silicon Valley
based venture capitalist with US Venture
Partners.
>> So I'm cautious about the value of the,
of the role of government.
If it's done light handedly which as far
as I can see so far, is the case here.
Then it can be quite good.
>> Morris Wheeler is an active angel
investor based in Cleveland.
>> Government can be an important, and
in some cases necessary, catalyst for
start-up activity.
But it shouldn't attempt to be the
kingmaker.
And it shouldn't attempt to design the
start-up activity.
Instead, it should look at the
entrepreneurs.
It should look at the needs.
And, and work to, as a as a catalyzer and
as a, an enabler.
Not as a controller of entrepreneurial
activity.
Some organizations involved in supporting
entrepreneurship around the world, such
as Endeavor, are less enthusiastic
about working closely with governmental
entities.
Peter Kellner is a co-founder of Endeavor.
>> Very early on, was Peter never taking
money from the government, particularly in
these countries because there are always
strings attached.
And you never know what's going to happen
in government.
People leave, people come in, the
incentives are
not aligned with your strategy, which is
long term.
>> So we've heard about the role of
government in the Cleveland case study.
But what is the experience of government
intervention internationally?
Let's look at a couple of perspectives.
Chris Zobrist, the Deputy Director at the
Vietman National University's John Von
Newman Institute
explains that the role of government in
Vietnam in supporting entrepreneurship is
still emerging.
>> In the past it hasn't, because the
ecosystem is so new and I think the
government hasn't really put much
attention
or thought into how to try to guide the
development of the anchor system.
In the end, I think the start-ups will be
successful, not, not necessarily because
of the government funding, but, but, it
would certainly help speed up the process.
>> Moez Dalloua of FSVC in Tunisia
discusses a Tunisian government program
that lacks the type of external match that
the Ohio Third Frontier requires.
>> For the entrepreneur they provide, I
mean, in some
schemes, they provide up to 96% of the
total project cost.
So entrepreneurs just put 4% of the total
amount
needed to to to, to fund this project, and
this is a situation where there is no skin
in the game, and speculative temptations
can be very important.
>> Government involvement in providing
support for entrepreneurship is
complicated.
The ultimate return on investment can take
years, if not
decades, and political leaders tend to
want results more quickly.
A few key factors to consider.
How big is the program?
Funding has to be large enough to make an
impact.
How will the program be set up to avoid
favoritism?
How diverse will the program be?
Would it fund different stages of
entrepreneurship from imagining to sales?
Would it fund both research and
entrepreneurship?
What metrics will be used to measure
success?
We will continue to look at the role of
Ohio's
Third Frontier Program in supporting
entrepreneurs in Cleveland and upcoming
lectures as we explore the formation of
intermediary organizations, leveraging
anchor institutions, seed acceleration and
promoting angel and venture capital
investments.
There have certainly been successes and
challenges in Ohio regarding
structuring government programs to support
new company formation and growth.
In our next lecture, we'll be looking at
how philanthropy or donors
can support entrepreneurship in the
community
alongside government and the private
sector.
See you next time.
