>> Hello again and welcome back to Beyond
Silicon Valley.
I'm Michael Goldberg.
This is the final lecture of this course.
Over the last eight lectures we examined,
in depth, the Cleveland case study.
As we discovered, a massive effort has
been undertaken in the
last ten years to support the growth of
entrepreneurship in northeast Ohio.
This effort was not accomplished through
private capital, as is the
norm in Silicon Valley, but rather through
government and donor support.
We heard from entrepreneurs and thought
leaders in Cleveland about the
array of programs introduced to provide
capital and support to start-up companies.
So looking back, how much progress has
been made in Cleveland?
And what will come in the future?
Remember that it was ranked 61 out of 61
regions in
the U.S. by Entrepreneur Magazine in 2002
in Friendliness to Entrepreneurs.
Have things improved for entrepreneurs?
If you were trying to start a company in
Cleveland today, would
you find an environment to grow your
business or would you look elsewhere?
It is clear that access to capital
for start-up companies in Cleveland has
improved significantly.
In 2013, 118 companies in Cleveland raised
$259 million from venture
capitalists, corporate and angel
investors, representing
an increase of 115% over 2004.
The number of companies attracting capital
has tripled.
Of northeast Ohio companies attracting
equity investment in
2013, slightly over 50% received an Angel
Investment.
10 years ago, Angel investing in startup
companies was a rare occurrence in
Cleveland.
Cleveland now has three active seed
accelerators that have
launched nearly 100 new companies over the
past three years.
Bruce Katz from the Brookings Institution
sees promise in Cleveland's progress.
>> You know, I think success can be
measured
on multiple levels at sort of a base
level.
You want to know that your investments are
growing
more jobs, quality jobs, attracting
private investment, market investment.
And all those measures for Northeast Ohio,
given these interventions can be shown.
>> So, yes, many would agree that great
progress has been made, however, many
challenges remain.
Investment capital for companies looking
to grow
past the seed stage is tightening with the
expiration of the Angel Tax Credit, and
uncertainty
about the renewal of the Ohio Capital
Fund.
Signs of donor fatigue.
Keeping political leaders and the public
engaged in
supporting entrepreneurship programs
beyond ten years can be difficult.
The region's resources are scarce and
needs are many.
And the lack of sizable exits in Northeast
Ohio calls into question whether or not
the region is capable of creating and
sustaining
successful return on investments in its
start ups.
We ask the entrepreneurs and thought
leaders from
Cleveland to reflect on the progress that
has been
made over the last ten years of
intervention, and
what needs to happen in order to sustain
it.
>> So, ten, ten years later, we, we've
come a long way, but,
and a lot of, you know, strong
intervention has happened, in the early
stages.
But it, we can't stop.
We can't, can't lessen up.
In fact, I think now is the time you can,
you should accelerate it.
Because you've got so much, you've built
this great platform
of fledgling companies, some of them
continuing on and actually growing.
So, some, some people are going to start
to
spin out from these companies, they're the
ones that
are going to be, those are the ones that
you are reaping from your investment to
build more companies.
But if there's no resources or money or
focus
going towards these new companies, you're
just going to, it's
going to sort of start to wither away and
sure,
you'll have a nice little hole that will
go forward.
But you've missed the benefit of the
investment that you've put through.
>> If you take a look at a ranking in
entrepreneurship, it's 61 out of 61.
You know you want to move up, and you,
then you start
putting things in place like
intermediaries,
seed capital, mentors, mentorship
programs, business
accelerators, where people can come
together and start businesses and have
the comradery of being in the same place
at the same time.
So they learn from each other.
So, you put all those things in place.
And then at some point you say, all of
these things
that you've put in place have to continue
to be fed.
Either with state money or business
community money or foundation funds.
>> We're about ten years in to
this economic transformation program in
entrepreneurship and
economic development more generally and I
think
we're justifiably very proud of the
progress.
But what do we call it?
A good start.
It took us about five decades to get into
the situation we were in.
And we believe that it's a multi decade
effort to,
to fully effectuate the turn around that
we're all seeking.
>> I think that's sort of the, the big
fear for a
region like Cleveland, if we decide for
whatever reason we're not going to
sustain our intense focus in investment
of, of resource in growing
that technology sector to the point where
it truly can be self sustaining.
>> If we were right in the beginning, and
I think
we were, that we were embarked upon a long
term process here.
A 20 to 30 year process.
And if we were successful in the first
decade of that, of that period,
in getting things started, then almost by
definition, that
support had to be continued in the second
decade and third decade,
or you would not reap the benefits of your
first decade investment.
>> One of the things that we spend a lot
of time talking to our funders about and
certainly are in
conversation, not just in Ohio, but in
regions across the country is, this
is a decades long process for most
communities.
If you're in a place that has had
huge economic distress, it's going to take
longer than
it would be in something that's been, you
know, more on the average issues and
challenges.
So for us, you know, we say, this is a
marathon, not a sprint.
>> This is a long-term play.
If Ohio takes its foot off the pedal right
now, and it has
taken its foot off the pedal a little bit,
you're going to see a reversal.
And we have seen some, some hiccups.
You know, we've got great momentum, but we
need
to keep on keeping our foot on the
accelerator.
>> Silicon Valley was not built in ten
years, so it is no surprise that the folks
involved in supporting entrepreneurship in
Cleveland are urging
similar patience in allowing the
entrepreneurial ecosystem to flourish.
Ten years is a short time for growing
a sustainable start-up environment,
especially considering the fact
that a major economic recession occurred a
few
years after the beginning of all the
efforts.
The programs put into place in Cleveland
to support entrepreneurship have not come
cheap.
JumpStart, the venture development
organization profiled
during the course, has received over $75
million in funding from donors and the
government since its founding in 2004.
As Dorothy Bonnick questioned, when will
there have been
enough intervention and when can the
market take over.
Some of JumpStart's government and
philanthropic funders are urging it and
other intermediary organizations to become
self
sustainable, or eventually cease to exist.
Otherwise, some fear that Cleveland will
have simply created an array
of well-funded intermediary organizations
rather
than catalyzed a healthy market place.
We asked our entrepreneurs and thought
leaders
in Cleveland to provide advice to other
transitioning economies around the world
that are
looking to support the growth of
entrepreneurship.
>> Be patient with entrepreneurs.
Understand that you likely won't see
financial successes right away in a,
as, as a community is trying to sort of
get started, right?
At the same time, failure will happen and
you have to accept it.
If you're going to measure the success of
your start up community by how many
companies, sort of, are successes right
out
of the gate, you're going to be
disappointed.
Because it's just not going to happen.
>> I, I think it's a eh, at its core it's
a fairly simple equation, right.
It's capital, it's, it's talent.
And it's, and it's the idea, and I think
that the,
the talent and the idea, having
universities nearby, or at least research
institutions well-funded, I think are
drivers of that, I think, capital, whether
it's philanthropic or venture, or any
other kind of for-profit investment.
is, is critical, critical to getting that
that equation to work.
Finding not only the, the, the, the talent
but the best talent, and
realizing that the best talent may or may
not be in your community
today but you might have to play a hand
in, in recruiting that talent.
To your, to your region so they're there
for tomorrow.
>> I think growing an entrepreneurial
economy is just
as dependent, as understanding the economy
that's already there.
And sometimes we get a little bit too
focused
on startups as if they are on an island.
And they're not, because in order for them
to grow, they're going
to have to develop customers among the
economy that's already in your region.
And so the portfolio approach, and keeping
start-ups as part of a portfolio as part
of the single answer I think is something
that, that regions have to understand.
>> And don't necessarily try to greenfield
something, don't try
to become the next Silicon Valley, or the
next software company.
Look at you, and see what assets you have,
and what kind of technology platforms are
there that you can invest in and build
on because you've got an asset base it's
there.
>> I think one of the most important
things that the country can learn, or
the world can learn, from what Northeast
Ohio has done is the collaboration that
happens.
It cannot be about your own organization
or building that.
It has to be about reaching into the
community, multiple organizations, call
all hands on deck.
You know, to make sure that these things
are moving forward.
And the more that the leaders and the
community and the organizations work
together, and, and then
figure out what your differentiation is
within that common
goal, the faster and the better it can
happen.
>> I was in, in Tunisia last year, and
just recently
in Egypt, and the entrepreneurs there are
just hungry for change there,
and they're hungry for an opportunity to
do something, as are, you
know, some of the government officials who
I met with in Tunisia.
And they always say, what do we do if we
don't have that kind of money?
We don't have $2.3 billion to invest in
entrepreneurship in Egypt.
What do we do?
How do we make change with the things we
have?
And I say, well, that's just it.
The, it's the things you have.
It's the resources and the assets that you
have
in your country that you use, that you
organize.
You organize people into a collaborative
activity so
that the best do what they do best.
>> So, we've seen that you don't have to
be in Silicon Valley to grow a company.
Cleveland's approach breaks the mold of
what is typical there.
Long term success is still an open
question but Northeast Ohio has
certainly garnered job growth, access to
capital and formed many new companies.
And communities around the world are
testing out other new ways
to grow entrepreneurship, that fit with
their own local resources and expertise.
One thing is certain, to launch more start
up companies in places with scarce
resources, community leaders need to act
more
like the entrepreneurs they're trying to
help.
Entrepreneurs take risks.
Leverage their network, and show grit and
hustle to try an build successful
companies.
I hope that the Cleveland case study and
our weekly interactive discussions outside
of these lectures
have provided you with an opportunity to
reflect
on what might work best in your
communities.
We all would love to have what Silicon
Valley has.
A robust entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Creating high paying jobs and exciting
technology based companies.
At some point, some years or decades from
now,
Cleavland, Hanoi, Ankara, Kigali, or Lima
may get there too.
It has been a pleasure presenting this
course.
Thank you for sharing your time with me.
I hope our paths cross again soon.
