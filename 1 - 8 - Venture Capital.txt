Hello again, and welcome back to Beyond
Silicon Valley.
I am Michael Goldberg.
We have just one lecture after this one,
and we've covered a lot so far, including
government
support for entrepreneurship, the role of
full philanthropy,
intermediary organizations, anchor
institutions,
seed accelerators and angel investing.
This time, we'll explore access to venture
capital.
Entrepreneurs who want to grow their
companies,
often dream of receiving an investment
from a leading venture capital fund, that
can provide capital and strategic advice.
But where your company is located can have
a big impact on access to venture capital.
In the United States, venture capital
funds are geographically concentrated in
select markets.
The majority of all venture capital
investing in
the U.S. occurs in Silicon Valley in San
Francisco.
Venture capital investors traditionally
want to
invest in companies that are close to
their offices, so they can provide
mentorship, and support on a regular
basis.
For entrepreneurs living in transitioning
economies, it remains extremely
challenging
to access the venture capital funding they
are looking for.
This advertisement for the renewal of the
Ohio Third Frontier in 2010, reminded Ohio
voters
of how far the state had to come
in providing venture capital and support
to entrepreneurs.
Communities around the world have to be
creative in their approach.
To entice private venture capitalists, to
support
companies' commercialization efforts after
receiving initial seed funding.
Or the money that typically comes from
friends and family, seed accelerators, and
angel investors.
The challenge that entrepreneurs face in
raising venture
capital, is sometimes called the valley of
death.
In many transitioning economies like
Cleveland, government and donor funded
programs
have been introduced to provide the
necessary funds to address this gap.
One such donor funded program is the 150
million dollar, Ohio Capital Fund.
Formed in 2006, and financed by the
government
of the state of Ohio, the Ohio Capital
Fund, is a fund of funds, launched to
make investment capital available for
Ohio-based early stage enterprises.
At a time when it was lacking.
The Ohio Capital Fund money, is invested
in venture capital
funds, alongside other private investors,
which then invest directly into companies.
Line Stream Technologies and embraced Pet
Insurance, are two start
up companies that received investment from
the Ohio Capital Fund.
Dave Neundorfer from LineStream, believes
this government funded venture
capital investment, was important to the
success of his company.
>> We've benefited greatly from some of
the state programs that have been put in
place starting with the Ohio Capital Fund
and their backer of early stage partners.
Early state partners provided our series A
funding
and then contributed towards our series B
funding.
So absolutely critical to our growth was
not only having the support from
early stage, but also at a higher level
the support from the state.
>> Laura Bennett found it difficult to
attract venture capital
investors from outside of Ohio, who wanted
to invest in Embrace.
>> When we were looking for, for funding
I, I went all over.
I went everywhere I could go the, where
people would actually open their door to
me.
So I did, fly out to California.
I went out to New York.
I spoke to extensively to venture capital
in Chicago.
But in the end I think, they always have
the, the nagging thought
that, oh, it's a bit of a pain to come out
to Cleveland.
Obviously California that, that is
difficult and unless they had
other bus, businesses here, makes it
probably not practical for them.
And so, you know, having local venture
capital firms, who care more about the
companies
in the area, than, you know, other areas,
is, is key for this area to grow.
>> Paul Cohn, the Managing Director of the
Ohio Capital
Fund, explains why the Ohio Capital Fund
was set up.
>> The Ohio Capital Fund was set up by
legislative action, actually,
recognizing that there was a void in early
stage venture capital in Ohio.
And so, the Ohio Capital Fund was set up
as a fund of funds, to invest into
venture capital funds and give them an
incentive
to invest into Ohio companies to fill that
void.
>> Cohn is employed by Fort Washington
Partners.
Which is a private investment management
firm, hired by
the State of Ohio to administer the Ohio
Capital Fund.
Elected officials in Ohio believed it was
important to have an independent,
experienced, professional
manager, to make recommendations to the
government,
regarding which fund should receive an
investment.
Unlike many of the Third Frontier Grants
we discussed in earlier lectures.
The government is expecting their
investment in the
Ohio Capital Fund, to be repaid in full.
Ten years ago there was a significant
venture capital gap in North East Ohio.
In 2004, start up companies in North East
Ohio, were only able
to raise 104 million dollars, which paled
in comparison to other regions.
Lisa Delp is the former director of the
Third Frontier.
>> After the angel fund, the angel funds
come in.
There is a need for a next stage of
capital, that was absent largely in Ohio.
We didn't have a lot of venture funds of
if we did, they were investing outside the
state.
So the state looked for ways to stimulate
that activity as well.
And the, the notion of the Ohio Capital
Fund came into being.
>> Suddenly, twelve venture capital funds
that had never had an office in Ohio, set
up a presence in the state, in order to
access an Ohio Capital Fund Investment.
Kohn explained, how the Ohio Capital Fund
insures that their funding
reaches start up companies in Cleveland
and other cities in Ohio.
>> The Ohio Capital Fund requires every
venture capital fund that
receives an investment from us, to invest
at least 50 cents
for ev, of every dollar that we give them,
at least
an amount equal to that, back into early
stage companies in Ohio.
We also require them, generally, to have a
presence in Ohio.
>> Having additional venture capital funds
in Ohio, has proven critical
for entrepreneurs in Cleveland looking for
access capital to grow their companies.
Baiju Shah is the former CEO of Bio
Enterprise.
>> What the state did here, which I think
was important in
something that would, you'd want to see
replicated, in any region or geography.
That was trying to stimulate a high
growth, ecosystem, is
they created a program whereby they are
attracted capital providers,
to the state, through an incentive in the
form of
an investment into those capital
providers, into the venture funds
themselves.
>> Several of Cleveland's leading
foundations, already involved in
supporting entrepreneurship through grant,
decided to make investment into
local venture capital funds, as they were
also concerned,
about the lack of available venture
capital for entrepreneurs.
These foundations understood, that they
expected return on
investment in unproven and venture capital
funds in
Cleveland, would likely be the below of
what
they could achieve as limited partners or
investors.
In other alternative investments, such as
Silicon Valley based venture capital
funds.
Ronn Richard is the CEO of the Cleveland
Foundation.
>> We wanted to invest, in local companies
giving away venture capital funds.
Either they have venture capital funds
giving venture capital
money to local firms, to grow more
companies in Cleveland.
Now that's called mission investing.
So, a lot of foundations are trying to use
their balance sheet side, not their rent
money, but
their corpus that they invest, they're
trying to think
about, you know, how can we leverage that
money too.
>> David Liddle is a venture partner at
the
Silicon Valley based venture capital fund,
U.S. Venture Partners.
>> You need to cultivate, limited
partners, a role that
local philanthropic, or foundation, or
government dollars
can play, is to stand in the place
of traditional limited partners until the
ball gets rolling.
>> Linestream Technology, received an
initial investment
from Early Stage Partners, a Cleveland
based venture
capital fund, whose limited partners
include the Ohio
Capital Fund and a number of Cleveland's
foundations.
Shortly thereafter, U.S. Venture Partners
made an investment in as well.
>> Northeast Ohio was a region that I
think benefited
from the, the priming of the pump if you
will.
In terms of providing some capital through
the state, through the government.
To get the flywheel turning, right?
And there were some very, very early firms
in, in the venture capital
space, Early Stage Partners being one of
them that kind of helped in parallel.
And benefited from that, that priming from
the state.
>> Government and donor intervention to
increase access to venture
capital in Cleveland, has created more
funding opportunities for entrepreneurs.
In 2013, 118 Cleveland companies raised
259 million dollars from venture
capitalists, as
well as corporate and angel investors
representing an increase of 115% over
2004.
And during that same time frame, the
number of companies
attracting venture capital, more than
tripled from 36 to 118.
Several acquisitions of starter companies,
have occurred over
the past several years, but Cleveland's
investors have
not benefited from a large IPO or
acquisition
on the scale of a Groupon, Nest or
Instagram.
Investors are still waiting to see if they
will enjoy the financial returns on their
investments
and local venture capital, that can
compete with
Silicon Valley, and other more developed
entrepreneurial eco-systems.
Other markets outside the U.S. are also
seeing significant support from
the government or donors, to increase
access for venture capital for
entrepreneurs.
Yi Zhang, of Kaiwu Capital, shares his
experience in China.
>> I work for Kaiwu Capital.
We are a venture capital fund based in
Beijing and we have a
overall, one billion [UNKNOWN] under
management.
Shanghai government is one of our limited
patners, and they [UNKNOWN] around
100,000,000 [UNKNOWN] which is equal to
50,000,000 U.S. Dollars into our fund.
Now, their expectation is not just get a
financial return as the other LP did.
They are, they understand that they do not
want to do the professional investment by
themselves.
And they want to market to select the best
start-up.
So, they, they understand the best way to
do
that, to invest in a professional firm
like us.
So, the expectation for them is, make sure
we invest
in a start-up [INAUDIBLE] the overall
economic GDP gross in Shanghai.
>> There are a growing number of
international impact investors, that are
deploying capital
in private companies in emerging
economies, and
taking a similar patient view on returns.
Impact investments are investments made in
the companies, organizations, and funds
with the intention to generate measurable
beneficial social impact, alongside
financial return.
Allen Taylor runs Endeavor's investor
network
program, which is focused on impact
investing.
>> The funds that are most aligned with
what Endeavor
is doing, believes in economic
development, and believe in job
creation, believe in funding great
companies to do that but
particularly in markets where the, the
liquidity environment's not very clear.
Exit opportunities don't occur to be
immediately available, they're willing to
take a
little bit of an extra risk and say, hey,
I might not earn
my money back in five years or seven
years, but I have a
good shot at doing it in ten years, and so
I'll make an investment.
>> So, to recap.
We've seen how government and donors can
help address a lack of venture capital
in the community, by becoming investors in
local venture capital funds, alongside
private investors.
Similar to many of the other programs we
have discussed during this course to
support entrepreneurship.
Investors in venture capital, need to
understand, that it could be
a decade before they will see potential
return on their investment.
The performance of venture capitals in
asset class, over the
past ten years globally, has trailed the
public equity market indexes.
And most of the best performing funds are
located in
Silicon Valley, where the highest
concentration of yield flow resides.
In 2011, venture capital investments at
the seed funding
stage in the United States, declined about
48% over the
prior year, and investments were
concentrated in social media, and
software, which are not areas of
particular emphasis in Cleveland.
Communities who want their entrepreneurs
to avoid the
fundraising valley of death, are
continuing to find
ways to intervene with creative,
professionally managed programs,
to try to make venture capital funding
available.
How do governments and donors measure the
success of their investments and venture
capital funds?
Investors in Silicon Valley, are solely
interested in Exit and Liquidity.
In Ohio, the 71 companies that have
received money from the Ohio Capital Fund,
have hired over 2500 employees, and are
generating almost 30 million dollars in
payroll taxes.
And while small, this economic development
impact, matters to government and
philanthropic investors.
They would like to see financial returns
from Exits, but these
realizations have been slower in the
Midwest, than in Silicon Valley.
The Ohio Capital Fund has fully allocated
their
investment capital, and it is not clear if
the fund will be renewed by the
government,
which means that new investments may not
be available.
Opponents of the Ohio Capital Fund,
believe that the private sector
should provide the necessary venture
capital
to fund companies, not the government.
This debate is playing out in transition
economies here, and outside the U.S., and
the success of these type of government
or donor funded programs, remains
uncertain and inconsistent.
That's it for now.
Next time will be our final course
lecture, where we will
recap our previous discussions, and look
to the future.
See you then.
