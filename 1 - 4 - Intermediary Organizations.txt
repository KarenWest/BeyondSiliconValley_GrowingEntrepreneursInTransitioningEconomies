Hello, and welcome back to Beyond Silicon
Valley.
I'm Michael Goldberg.
In the previous lectures, we learned about
the important role that government
and donors can play in the formation of
new, high growth companies.
In Cleveland, government and donors
committed significant resources to back
entrepreneurs.
But leaders quickly realized that an
organization was needed
to appropriately and wisely deploy this
investment into private companies.
Modeled on a program called Innovation
Works
in Pittsburgh, JumpStart was created in
2004.
As a venture development, nonprofit
organization to support innovative startup
companies.
By providing pre-seed funding, developing
networks of angel investors.
And making connections for follow-on
funding for venture capital firms.
JumpStart also provides technical
assistance and support to
help entrepreneurs develop their business
plans, connect to mentors.
And attract the necessary talent to manage
and grow their companies.
But creating and staffing an intermediary
organization with talented
leaders from the private sector would take
significant resources.
To date, JumpStart has received over $75
million in funds to deliver its programs.
In this lecture, you will learn, why
Cleveland
created an organization like JumpStart to
support entrepreneurship.
How an intermediary organization measures
success.
And what challenges it faces.
Laura Bennett the founder of Embrace Pet
Insurance was
the first entrepreneur to receive an
investment from JumpStart.
>> What we do is we do, we sell and, we
design,
sell pet health insurance for cats and
dogs across the United States.
And, in the, a product covers the
unexpected bills
like anything from an ear infection
through to cancer treatments.
Which will, can be very, very expensive.
To, unex, you know, the usual stuff like
regular vet visits and so on.
We started off with two people with a
business plan.
We're now very close to 58 people.
So when I first moved to Cleveland which
was back in 2004, there was nothing.
Nothing here for entrepreneurs, or at
least it was very minimal.
And in fact when we first spoke
to JumpStart, was literally they were
first forming.
We met in a coffee shop because they
didn't have any offices.
And, so the entrepreneurship environment
has developed since, since then.
Back then there were no angel funds, now
there are at least, there's at least one.
There were no accelerators, those have
only occurred in the last couple of years.
So it was really,
forming at that time.
There was, there was nothing.
So over, over that time, over the last
ten, ten years, a lot has changed.
>> While there were resources available
from government
and donor sources in Cleveland to support
entrepreneurship.
Funders believed that it was necessary to
create an intermediary not for profit
organization.
Jackie Acho and Dorothy Baunach were two
leaders
in Cleveland that advocated for the
creation of JumpStart.
>> When you have got an economy that
doesn't really have a market at the early
stage.
And you are trying to create a market.
When there's not a market, private money's
not going to flow in.
Nor will private services and you know,
the things
that would need to support those kinds of
businesses.
The government could try to directly
invest, but
they're not really well suited to do that.
A lot of it was an experiment.
And so we had to create intermediaries
that were capable of innovating.
The way that the support and the money
would flow to companies.
>> Well, if you look at intermediary
organizations, they are really
the intermediaries between the research
base or the idea generation base.
And the marketplace.
And you put them in place because the
market system isn't working.
There's not a natural way for these ideas
to get to market.
So when you have lost the natural pathways
for
that, you put it in an intervention, an
intermediary.
And we did that for entrepreneurship.
We did that for specific industries like
biomedical, or materials.
Or even manufacturing.
Because manufacturing was changing
overnight in the midst of all of this.
>> Since its founding in 2004.
JumpStart has evolved to respond to what
it perceives as the
needs of the local entrepreneurs and the
demands of its funders.
Including the third frontier and
philanthropic donors,
like the Fund for our Economic Future.
Ray Leach is JumpStart's CEO.
>> So one of the things I think that's
really neat and
what's very unusual ten years ago, it's a
little less unusual now.
Is that JumpStart was created a not for
profit organization, an NGO.
Whose principle focus was leveraging, kind
of a venture capital expertise model.
But doing it for economic development
outcomes.
So all of our activity from day one,
wasn't to
maximize profits for the institution, or
even for our supporters.
It was to create a wave of momentum And
create acceleration around company
formation and the ability of those
companies to be able to attract capital.
>> Anthony Hughes runs JumpStart's
mentoring program.
>> You know, Northeast Ohio was a very
vibrant ecosystem in the early 1900s.
We unfortunately took a real hit and, you
know, with
globalization, and in the decline of
manufacturing in North America.
And so our ecosystem was fairly barren.
Now, the notion, or, the, the, the analogy
that I think is most
appropriate for a place like northeast
Ohio,
is this notion of an artificial reef.
The ecosystem didn't really exist when,
when we started to focus
heavily on how to build an ecosystem or
rebuild an ecosystem.
And so in some capacity JumpStart with
part, is like an artificial reef.
It's an artificial construct on which an
ecosystem can rebuild itself.
>> In ten years, Jumpstart has invested
nearly $30 million
directly into its 76 startup companies
through its investment fund.
JumpStart provides funding at the seed
capital stage, when
it is extremely critical for capital to be
locally available.
JumpStart's fund is structured as what is
known as an evergreen.
Which means any investment gains that it
makes on its portfolio companies,
gets put back into the fund to be invested
in new companies.
>> So one of the philosophies that we have
at JumpStart that I think
is true everywhere, is that you need
a balance of both capital and technical
assistance.
Or mentoring and coaching.
And one of the most important vehicles
that JumpStart was able to
create in the early days, is what we call
our evergreen fund.
Which was, ultimately has ended up being a
pool of $30 million.
About 60% of that has come from the state
and public sector entities.
And 40% has come from private foundations
and community leaders
that enable us to take the dollars in as
philanthropy.
And then with those dollars make very,
very risk friendly and
yet still high risk investments in
entrepreneurs who've never raised capital
before.
>> Ray references JumpStart's fund
beginning to
see some initial returns on its
investment.
Which occur when a company is sold or has
an initial public offering.
It has been difficult, not just in
Cleveland but
worldwide for any early stage company to
make an exit.
And as a result, the returns for venture
capital as
an asset class over the past decade have
been weak.
JumpStart is still waiting for a sizeable
exit from their portfolio.
Jackie Acho serves on JumpStart's Board of
Directors.
>> I think JumpStart has to have exits to
be a success.
But I don't think it needs a Groupon like
exit.
In fact, I don't think that's the way
economies are built.
I think it's built on many more smaller
exits and successes.
And I think those are in the coming.
You know, it's been seven years or so
since it started.
So it does take time for these things to
mature.
>> While exits are a key metric
JumpStart's funders use to measure their
effectiveness, other measurements of
success include the
ability of Jumpstart's portfolio to raise
capital.
To generate revenue and to create jobs.
Cleveland's entrepreneurs have come to
depend on JumpStart for
support during this challenging start-up
phase of their businesses.
>> Without JumpStart there would be no
embrace, we wouldn't be here today.
We had nothing to start with.
We weren't, so my business partner Alex
Krooglik and I, we're not from around
here.
In fact you might be able to tell, we're
not from around the US at all.
And so we didn't have connections here.
We'd never done pet insurance before.
And we were not even insurance brokers.
We even had JumpStart come to London to
help negotiate our arrangement with
Lloyd's of London.
So Lloyd's of London was our first
insurance partner.
We're not an insurance company, we need an
insurance partner.
So JumpStart's Mark Smith, came with us to
help,
to help Lloyd see that it wasn't just two
people with a business plan.
That it was the whole of northeast Ohio
behind us.
>> Wireless Environment's David Levine
credits JumpStart for pushing
him to recruit a more dynamic board of
directors.
>> Besides the, the cash infusion which
JumpStart provided to us.
And the kind of, the credibility hit that
it gave us.
An increasing credibility.
We benefited from JumpStart's ability to,
explain to us the,
the various stages of, of forming and
growing a company.
And the important milestones and, and
actions that needed to be taken.
>> There are intermediary organizations
like JumpStart
working in markets all over the world.
Like JumpStart they are
typically structured as non-governmental
organizations.
Let's take a look at a couple.
Endeavor is an NGO focused on mentoring
and
accelerating the best high impact
entrepreneurs around the world.
Gabriela Macagni, is the Managing Director
of Endeavor Argentina.
>> Endeavor Argentina as every single
office as in Endeavor
worldwide.
We are, our focus is on
searching and selecting entrepreneurs,
high impact entrepreneurs.
And mentoring them after they have been
selected in an international panel.
That's basically the one single model that
we have in every single country.
Now on, on top of that, we do a
lot of inspiring new entrepreneurship or
creating the entrepreneurship culture.
So we do some massive events in eight
different provinces of the country.
is more like a TEDx Dynamic.
Where we have entrepreneurs, our, our role
models, our Endeavor role
models tell their story to many people so
they get inspired.
And we provide some additional technical
support with classes
or debates on a specific technique or
subjects for entrepreneurs.
>> The jobs at companies like
Embrace Pet Insurance, CardioInsight, and
Wireless Environment,
represent the type of employment that
communities
around the world are looking to create.
Job growth at these companies is steady.
But no company in JumpStart's portfolio is
yet employing thousands of people.
The challenge for Jumpstart and many other
intermediary organizations supporting
entrepreneurship around the world,
is to convince governments and donors to
continue with their funding over the long
term.
So investments have a chance to bear
fruit, in terms of job creation and
profit.
As a result, JumpStart is being asked by
it's
funders to explore new ways to become self
sustainable.
Including consulting other communities on
venture development and
setting up a new for profit investment
fund.
The other question that looms for
intermediary
organizations like JumpStart, is when they
have
accomplished enough in support of
entrepreneurship, do
they still have a reason to exist?
In our next lecture we will look at the
role that
anchor institutions such as universities,
play
in driving entrepreneurship in a
community.
See you next time.
